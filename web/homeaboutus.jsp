        <h1>BLOOD BANK</h1>
        <p>Blood cannot be manufactured in factories; it can only come from generous donors. To cater to this demand, BloodConnect was launched on 1st April, 2010 (as a project under NSS IIT Delhi) with an unparalleled objective of solving the problem of blood shortage in India.

According to WHO data, India faces a shortage of 3 million blood units. This shortage can easily be eliminated if only an additional 2% of India's youth donates blood. To make this possible, BloodConnect acts as a channel connecting voluntary blood donors with those who need blood. It is a youth-run organization and provides free help and specially works to target the poor and the needy.

Since its inception, the organization has grown a lot in terms of working for this cause. BloodConnect has developed a 360 degree solution to the problem of blood shortage. The model revolves around 4 focal points:

Ensuring continuous, sufficient blood supply to blood banks through blood donation camps and weekly donations
Improving awareness by organizing Street Plays, Info-Talks, Competitions
Helping those in dire need by operating an emergency 24x7 helpline
Establishing a network of youth across the country to lead the movement

Mission: To be a 360-degree solution provider to the problem of blood shortage in India 

Vision: To solve the problem of blood shortage in India in our lifetime
